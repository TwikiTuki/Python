### COOKING

> In this exercise I implement a cooking book manager. It is made by 3 classes Book, Recipe, Interface. It is possible to add delete or search Recipes in a book, and the Interface class provides a tool for managing it from the command line. It is also possible to import the classes and use them in with other code.

> Usage:
>``` shell
>    python3 cooking.py
>```
